REMOVE FBMATRIX, IT DOESNT HELP

fbmatrix should go in adata
unify adata?

separate constants from helper structures?

state should have wbank

if only ndarray had masking, this would be a lot simpler, cooler, and faster

add shortcut for sdata load 
  pub fn load<P>(
    fbp: &P,
    hdp: &P,
    ldp: &p,
    cachenrows: usize,
    cachencols: usize,
    ntops1: u32,
    ntops2: u32,
    ecut: 32
  ) -> Self {

  }

Old Notes
## TODO
### General
* generating data in parallel messes with timings kind of?
* better error handling
* use Path instead of AsPath
* get rid of WBank?
* more benchmarks + tests
* explain scripts + dependencies in README
* look at each files TODOs
* create github releases?
* make more easily installable
  - try to publish to AUR?
  - create packages for more distros
* integrate solver with tui?
* make decision tree viewer in tui
### Solver
* PROFILES
* fix patch for ntops with hard
* add cache settings to main?
* record cache stats
* standardize types for stuff like NLETS and wlen
* check if solve strings are impossible? (allow impossible with --dirty)
* improve dtree pprint format
* make cache work for hard mode
* isolate fbmaps + methods (simplify wlen <= 5 optimizations)
* optimization:
  - is making dtree slow?
  - don't need to sort entire vec for selection
* see how decision tree would process specific answer(s)?
### Generation
* default to out's settings
* settings profiles?
* also check wbanks and hdata?
* range has option for single
### Game
* why do my ctrl-backspaces get sent as ctrl-h's?
* why doesn't backtab work?
* dictionary capabilities
* keep statistics and track pb's
* adjust layout for overflow
* re-add unknowns
* display pace
* multiple in a row?
  - exordle
  - infinite
* optionally show known letters beneath columns (or above?)
* single word
  - different layout for single
  - different modes like hard mode
* sync with wordle, duordle, quordle, octordle's, etc daily
* config
  - better error handling
  - unknowns
  - find out how to remove serde_json dependency from config (features)
